# PokemonGuesser
An app (APK) to learn Pokémon names and forms in an easy and simple way. The APK file isn't directly available in this repository as it is more than 100 MB. These are the GODOT files.

# How to play
When you start the app you will be in the main menu. From there, you may choose your audio preferences and then select a game mode.

The NAMES button will show you a menu with all regions. Click the title to return to the main menu. Choose and click a region to look at your progress in that region. The corresponding Pokédex will be shown. A colored Pokémon means you have guessed that Pokémon correcty at least once. A black shade means you have encountered it but failed to guess it, and a number means that you have not yet encountered that Pokémon. To start guessing, click the region label you want and press the START button that will be displayed. The round tags with numbers next to the region names show the highest amount of Pokémon you have guessed in one go. If you manage to obtain the max score for said region, the tag will become brighter. When you start a game, a Pokémon will be shown and you may write its name in English. When you are finished, either press the SUBMIT button or the intro button in your digital keybord. It will automatically be corrected. If right, you score a point. If wrong, you gain a strike. With three strikes, you will return to the menu. Press the NEXT button to move to the next Pokémon.

The FORMS button will show you a Pokémon. The first one will always be ALCREMIE. You shall choose a form using the option button. The rest is as in the NAMES game mode. If you manage to guess all Pokémon forms, except for Spinda, as it is said it has infinite forms, the FORMS button will obtain a different color.

Progress is saved between sessions as long as you return to a menu.

# About autocorrection
If your digital keybord includes the autocorrection function, you may find issues when submitting through the intro button. Measures have been taken against autocorrection, yet problems may still occur. Putting a space and then checking the name before finally submitting or using the SUBMIT button instead of the intro are viable ways to overpass this issue.
